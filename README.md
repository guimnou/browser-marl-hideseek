## 🎮 Features
- **Multi-Agent Training**: Train multiple NPCs using the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
- **3D Voxel World**: Navigate through a unique voxel-based environment.
- **Real-Time Learning**: NPCs learn in real time, adapting their strategies as you play.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Efficient communication between your browser and the server for smooth gameplay.

## 🔧 How It Works
The **browser-marl-hideseek** application utilizes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. This means NPCs learn how to hide and seek by interacting with the environment, much like humans do. The software communicates with a server using WebSockets, allowing for real-time updates and actions.

The core algorithm used is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which helps NPCs improve their gameplay through trial and error. This creates a fun and engaging experience.
